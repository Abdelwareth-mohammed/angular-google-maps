# Intro
Components, directives and event handlers try to give you as much control as possible out of the box. However, advanced scenarios will probably require a different approach. This page will guide you through extracting the underlying objects from the components and using them to programmatically control what's going on with your maps.

# Accessing Wrappers

## Event Handlers
When an event is emitted, given that you passed in the `$event` argument, you will have direct access to the wrapper  which emitted the event:

```html
<!-- Your component template -->

<bs-google-map *bsSafe>
    <bs-google-maps-polygon [path]="[[1,1], [2,2], [3,3]]"
                            (click)="onPolygonClick($event)"></bs-google-maps-polygon>
</bs-google-map>
```

```typescript
// Your component class

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { GoogleMapsEventData, ZoomLevel, GoogleMap } from '@bespunky/angular-google-maps/core';
import { GoogleMapsPolygon } from '@bespunky/angular-google-maps/overlays';

@Component({...})
export class MyMapComponent
{
    public onPolygonClick(event: GoogleMapsEventData)
    {
        const polygon       = event.emitter as GoogleMapsPolygon; // Access emitting polygon
        const map           = polygon.map as GoogleMap; // Access to the containing map instance
        const nativePolygon = polygon.native; // Access to native google.maps.Polygon object
        const nativeMap     = map.native; // Access to native google.maps.Map object
       
        polygon.setFillColor('green');
        polygon.map.setZoom(ZoomLevel.Buildings);

        // ... more manipulation
    }
}
```

> If you're thinking of storing the emitter instance as a component member so you may use it in other places as well, you can. However, it is probably better if you fetch it on init instead. Keep reading... ðŸ˜‰

## Querying The View
TODO: Add example with ViewChild

## Template References
TODO: Add example with template reference variables and passing in the wrapper to a method, both to another template element, and to a component method.

```html
<... #map></..>
<something (click)="map.wrapper.addPolygon(....)"/>
<somethingElse (click)="do(map.wrapper)"/>
```

# Custom Data
Regardless of their type, every wrapper has a `custom` property which you can use for anything. This might serve you well for storing an entity, a configuration, or an id.

This is extremely useful when handling large amounts of overlays. Once you associated an entity with a wrapper instance, you simply extract it from the emitter when an event was triggered and work on entity. **No need for keeping track of your objects, or scanning your arrays to find the relevant object.**

Here's an example:
