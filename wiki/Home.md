# Motivation
There are a few Angular libraries out there for Google Maps. So why develop a new one?
1. I'm working on a project where the map is the heart of the app. I need full flexibility and quick response time. I can't afford an "oh shut... their library doesn't support this. Now what do I do??" moment. Fork it? Make a pull request? File an issue and hope for the best?...
