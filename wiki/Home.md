# Motivation
There are a few Angular libraries out there for Google Maps. So why develop a new one?

## Flexibility and quick response time
I'm working on a project where the map is the heart of the app. I can't afford an "oh shut... their library doesn't support this. Now what do I do??" moment. Fork it? Make a pull request? File an issue and hope for the best?...

## Facilitating map functionality
Maybe they wanted to reduce package size, or maybe it was simply a lack of initiative, but having used Google Maps API in different contexts in the last few years, I've always found that it lacks some basic functionality. I would like my library to take care of stuff for me. No manual map related labour in the app itself.

## Usage and code style
We all have preferences as developers. I want my library to work a certain way and provide me with a certain API. I've always had some nice ideas regarding how it should be used. It was time to implement.

## The challenge
Of course 😁

# Issues & Requests
Unfortunately, Azure DevOps doesn't support issue collection. I'm considering moving this repo to GitHub.  
In the meantime, any issues or requests can be sent to [us@bespunky.io](mailto:us@bespunky.io?subject=@bespunky/angular-google-maps).
