# Intro
At the core of the library is the map. The map component will always be the top-level container for all other library components or directives. 

To place a map in your template, use the `<bs-google-map/>` element.
> Haha, yeah... üòÑ `bs` stands BeSpunky... Not the other thing you were thinking. üòè

Content and tools related to the map instance you're defining will always go as children of your `<bs-google-map/>` element.

# Options
To configure your map, simply bind options using angular's syntax:

```html
<bs-google-map *bsSafe 
               [center]="center"
               [zoom]="3"
               [clickableIcons]="false"
               ...
></bs-google-map>
```
