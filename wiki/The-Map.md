# Core Component
At the heart of the library is the map. The map component will always be the top-level container for all other library components or directives. 

To place a map in your template, use the `<bs-google-map/>` element.
> Haha, yeah... üòÑ `bs` stands for BeSpunky... Not the other thing you were thinking. üòè

Content and tools related to the map instance you're defining will always go as children of your `<bs-google-map/>` element.

# Options
[Live demo](https://bs-angular-g-maps.web.app/The%20Map/Map%20Options)

To configure your map, simply bind options using angular's syntax:

```html
<bs-google-map *bsSafe 
               [center]="center"
               [zoom]="3"
               [clickableIcons]="false"
               ...
></bs-google-map>
```

> [See API](/docs/components/GoogleMapComponent.html#inputs) for a complete list of supported bindable `@Input` options and their types.

# Events
[Live demo](https://bs-angular-g-maps.web.app/The%20Map/Map%20Events)

To handle events emitted by your map, simply bind handlers using angular's syntax and pass in the `$event` variable:
```html
<bs-google-map *bsSafe 
               (click)="onMapClick($event)"
               (mouseMove)="onMapMouseMove($event)"
               ...
></bs-google-map>
```

> [See API](/docs/components/GoogleMapComponent.html#outputs) for a complete list of supported bindable `@Output` events and their `$event` type.

# Styles
Inside of a `<bs-google-map/>` component, the top level container is always a `div.google-map` element. The map component is defined with no view encapsulation, meaning you can use the `.google-map` css selector to identify map elements and apply styles from your host component if necessary.

> Another way would be using a `::ng-deep .google-map` css selector to identify map elements and apply styles from your host component if necessary. [See `::ng-deep` deprecation discussion](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/25160).
