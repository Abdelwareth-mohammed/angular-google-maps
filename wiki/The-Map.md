# Intro
At the core of the library is the map. The map component will always be the top-level container for all other library components or directives. 

To place a map in your template, use the `<bs-google-map/>` element.
> Haha, yeah... 😄 `bs` stands BeSpunky... Not the other thing you were thinking. 😏

Content and tools related to the map instance you're defining will always go as children of your `<bs-google-map/>` element.
