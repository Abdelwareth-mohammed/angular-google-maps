# Concepts
The data layer is [different to the rest of the overlays](/Overlays-Superpower#Data-Layer-vs.-Normal-Overlays). It doesn't do much on its own, and is meant to be used in conjunction with [geometry features](/Overlays-Superpower/Data-Layer/Geometry-Features).

You must either place geometry feature directives inside of the data directive or use the wrapper to create the features.

## Feature Events
The native data layer object raises events for features it holds, which in turn means you'd have to find out which feature raised the event. `<bs-google-maps-data/>` and `<bs-google-maps-feature>` play nicely together to bridge this. See [Geometry Features](/Overlays-Superpower/Data-Layer/Geometry-Features).

## Feature Tracking
<small>[How do I access the wrapper?](/Programmatic-Control)</small>

The wrapper implements feature tracking automatically. Access tracked features using the `features` property:
```typescript
const data = ... // Fetch the data layer wrapper

const yourFeatures = data.features.list; // GoogleMapsFeature[]
```

> Unlike [overlay tracker](/Overlays-Superpower#overlay-tracking), the features tracker doesn't provide a `changes` observable. That is because the native data layer already provides events for detecting changes. Bind your `<bs-google-maps-data>` directive's `addFeature` and `removeFeature` events and you'll get the same result. [See demo](https://bs-angular-ggl-maps-demo.web.app/Overlays%20Superpower/Data%20Layer) for more details.

# Subject to Change
As with feature events, `@bespunky/angular-google-maps` aspires bridging the gap between the native data object and the native feature objects it holds. So feature styling and other tasks are about to become a lot easier. 

Stay tuned for new versions and breaking changes...
